        <p>Bolognese is a meat based pasta sauce
            originating in the city of Bologna in
            Italy. While primarily meat and tomato
            based, it often includes other vegetable
            such as carrots and celery. This slow
            cooked italian staple will become one of
            your new favorites.

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup finely diced onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely diced celery</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely diced carrot</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups 2% milk</li>
            <li>2 cups white wine</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole italian plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan 
                over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, 
                and 1 pinch salt; cook and stir until onion 
                turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir ground beef into vegetables; cook and stir 
                until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 
                5 minutes. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 
                nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to 
                a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until most 
                of the milk has evaporated and the bottom of 
                the pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high and pour in white 
                wine; cook and stir until wine has mostly 
                evaporated, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing 
                bowl; crush them with your hands until they 
                resemble a chunky sauce. Pour tomato mixture 
                into ground beef mixture; fill the tomato can 
                with 2 cups water and stir into sauce. Bring 
                to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, 
                until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at 
                least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim 
                fat from the top of sauce if desired. Add more 
                water if sauce is too thick. Taste and adjust 
                seasonings before serving.</li>
        </ol>
