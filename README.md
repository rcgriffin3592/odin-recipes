Recipe Page project for The Odin Project

This project is my first major project in The Odin Project curriculum.
During this project I will create a webpage for recipes containing
images as well links to other pages.

This project will serve to practice the HTML knowledge I have gained in
the course so far. For example, linking to other pages on the site
using the <a> tag and href attribute, adding images using the <img> tag 
and src attribute, adding text with the <p> tag, and formatting the 
webpage and file system.
